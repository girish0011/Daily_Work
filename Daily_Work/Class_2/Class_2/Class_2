Static Non Static

Class A 
     -> Every time when we write outside the object it will divide in the static
        and non static.
     
     -> anything which is not written by "static" keyword is a non static and it will goes
        in the object and written with "static" keyword goes to the common memory 
        of the class.  (like "int x = 10" and "static int y = 100")
     
     -> when we want call the non static once we need to first write the object name then dot
        and the name of non static  (like a1.x)
     
     -> when we want to call the static once we just need to write the class name dot and the 
        name of static once. (like A.y)
        
 Rules for the Non Static
 
     -> If you to access non stating first you should create an object.
     -> 
      
 Rules for the Static
 
     -> Static belongs to class.
     -> 
     
     
Sir Notes 

Non Static :- 
     
     1. These variables are created outside the outside method and inside the class.
        without static keyword.
     2. Non static member belongs to object.objecty is also called as  instance.
     3. the below program show error because we are accessing without object
        program 
         
        package Class_2;

        public interface A1 {
	       int x = 10; // non static ( object)

	       public static void main(String[] args) {
		          System.out.println(A.x); //Error
	          }

            } 
     4. To access non static we first create object and then we access the non static.
     
     package Class_2;

        public interface A1 {
	       int x = 10; // non static ( object)

	    public static void main(String[] args) {
		          A a1 = new A ();
		   System.out.println(a1.x);//Error
	      }

        }
