every class has a specific name and we should be use it in every time when we call.
as shown in program below.
      public class A {
      public.static.vaid main (String[]args){
      
At this stage you should be use the class name accurate class name,
like A a1 in this line A is a class name and a1 is the object name.
so now the program like,

       A a1 = new A();
       
using new keyword for the creating new object.

       System.out.println(a1);
       
      }
      this curly bracket closes the main method.
    }
     This curly bracket closes the class of the program.
     
     
now try same code with different class
            public class Gk {
            public.Static.void main (String[]args){
            
            Gk a1 = new Gk();
            
            here is the change in first program the class name is A and in this
            program the class name is Gk.
            
            System.out.println(a1);
            }
           }
            

Notes on first class:

for creating an object you should click the button so in this program new keyword
is a button and a class is the machine for creating object.

1) Class :-
      
      -> class helps us to generate objects.
      -> Every class has a common memory.

Ex:- Machine.
      
2) new keyword :-  A a1 = new A ();

      -> It sends request to the class to create object.
      -> once object is created new keyword will get object address & stores that 
         will get object address & stores that in a reference variable. 

Ex :- Button.
        
3) Garbage Collector :-

      -> Garbage collector on regular basis keeps removing objects from the memory
         which are not in use.
      -> which helps us to manage memory in efficient manner.
      
Ex:- kid , maid.      

every time kid is throwing the things in garbage box after filling 90 % garbage box
maid clean the box as the same way garbage collector works.
