Modifying Variable.

Example :- Xerox book (we will write anything on the copy)

we can modify the value either non static or static

****Static value will be change in java*** 

In a class their is only one space for the variable the value of variable changes 
and it remains same for next use of the variable like suppose
first the value of x is 10 then we change it to the 1000 so now the value of x will only 1000
and 10 will be erased.(once you alter the value of x, then main copy of x will be altered)



Sir notes

Static :-

     -> Static variable is created outside the method but inside the class 
        using static keyword.
     -> Static variables belongs to class.
     -> Do not create object to access to static variable,we access the variable
        with class name.
     -> Static variable value can be change as shown in example.
     -> There is only one copy of static variable, which get stored in common memory.
        if you change the value of x then main copy of x variable value gets altered.
        you can change it any number of time
